Deep in the ocean, dead and cast away
Where innocences burn in flames
A million mile from home, I'm walking ahead
I'm frozen to the bones, I am

A soldier on my own, I don't know the way
I'm riding up the heights of shame
I'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest
I'm ready for the fight, and fate

The sound of iron shocks is stuck in my head
The thunder of the drums, dictates
